(ns design-studio.advisor
  "DesignOpsAdvisor — proposes a design-studio operation (proof production,
  design delivery) for a client project. The advisor is swappable:
  `mock-advisor` (deterministic, default in dev/tests/CI) or `llm-advisor`
  (wraps a real `langchain.model/ChatModel`). Either way the advisor ONLY
  produces a PROPOSAL — it never writes to the store and has no notion of
  asset licensing or brand guidelines; `design-studio.governor` is the
  independent system that decides whether the proposal may proceed, per the
  itonami actor pattern.

  A proposal is a map:
    {:op :produce-proof|:deliver-design
     :effect :propose        ; the advisor NEVER emits a raw store write
     :stake :low|:medium|:high
     :confidence 0.0-1.0
     :rationale str}
  LLM parse failures always yield `:confidence 0.0` (never fabricate
  confidence), which forces the governor to escalate/hold."
